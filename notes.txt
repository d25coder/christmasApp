// misspelled column name in actor table
ALTER TABLE actor
CHANGE LName lName VARCHAR(40);

SELECT program.title, actor.fName, actor.LName, program.yr_released
FROM program 
JOIN actor ON program.actor_id = actor.actor_id;  

 // Drop a table 
 DROP TABLE program_to_actor;
 DROP TABLE program_to_director;
 DROP TABLE program_to_streaming_platform;


// Fix FOREIGN KEY in schema.sql
  Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (`christmasapi`.`program_to_actor`, CONSTRAINT `fk_actor_to_prog` FOREIGN KEY (`actor_id`) REFERENCES `acto
r` (`actor_id`))
-this means that the number of actors or programs are not the same
-i had 145 actors in data.sql, it needs to be 143.


// Error Not Defined
-this means there is a spelling Error
-check call back functions in fileDao.js
